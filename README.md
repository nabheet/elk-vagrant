# ElasticSearch, Kibana and Logstash
This Vagrantfile contains a VM with ElasticSearch, Kibana and Logstash for PoCs and quick demos.

I found myself always looking for yum repos and configuration options to install ElasticSearch,
kibana and logstash. I created this Vagrantfile so I don't have to waste time digging around for
all the details to install the ELK stack.
